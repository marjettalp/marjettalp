- 👋 Hi, I’m @marjettalp
- 👀 I’m interested in: 1) modelling past, current and future cyclone impacts on the world's coral reefs and 2) spatial variation in model accuracy and the implications this has on how such models should be used.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to expand my programming skills beyond the old style world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the above.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
